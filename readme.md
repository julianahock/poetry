README

This is our readme file. 
We can communicate here a bit, 
but also doing things through email would probably still be good.

I'm also just checking to see that edits can be made
I'm also not sure what exactly should go in a readme file,
but if anyone knows, feel free to add that.

I think also we should each have our own fork off the master file
and then push changes to each fork,

and then do pull requests to the other three people in the group
for it to merge with the main again

so hopefully now we can sort of get going with this poetry website project
